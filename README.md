# ATmega32_counter-system.🧮
This project implements a binary counter using an AVR microcontroller and demonstrates fundamental skills in hardware interfacing and embedded C programming.

# Features 
-Increment / Decrement binary numbers (0–7) via push buttons.
-Pause / Resume counter operations.
-Reset to zero with LED flashing indication.
-Binary output displayed on RGB LEDs.
-7-segment display to show the current number.
-Buzzer alerts for invalid operations (incrementing past 7 or decrementing below 0).

✅ Debounced button handling
✅ Includes Proteus simulation

# components and tools🖥️
-ATmega32 microcontroller
-7-segment display
-3 LEDs (Red, Green, Blue)
-4 Push buttons (for increment , decrement , pause , reset)
-Buzzer
-Proteus for simulation and circuit design
-ETA Burner for uploading the HEX file to the physical board

# Flashing the Code to ATmega32🔌
Open ETA Burner, select your HEX file, and connect the board.
Burn the HEX to the ATmega32 chip.
Use the Proteus simulation to test, or upload to a real board.
